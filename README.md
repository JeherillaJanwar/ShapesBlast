# ShapesBlast

# What is it about?
ShapesBlast is played by swiping shapes, in any direction (so long as it is not blocked), to create sets of 3 or more matching shapes. When matched, the shapes will blast and shift the shapes above them, allowing you to accomplish a series of different goals. Match more than 3 candies to create combos.
